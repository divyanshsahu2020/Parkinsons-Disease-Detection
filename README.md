# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection
DESCRIPTION - Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder with more than 6 million people worldwide suffering from it.It is commonly diagnosed using clinical assessments and progression scale which usually depends on the medical practitioner’s expertise ,and accuracy varies greatly between various examiners which also takes a long time to accurately diagnose.
This project proposes to develop a computer aided diagnostic method to diagnose Parkinsons Disease patients using MRI images of the brain ,which in turn reduces cross examiner variability and the time required to diagnose.
